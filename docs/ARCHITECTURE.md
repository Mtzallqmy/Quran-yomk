# Quran Yutla (قرآن يتلى) — Architecture Overview

## 1. Vision & Identity
«قرآن يتلى» is an independent, production-grade platform dedicated to high-fidelity Holy Quran recitations, scheduled 24/7 radio broadcasting, and reading experiences. It provides an Arabic-first user experience designed around reverence, clarity, performance, and accessibility.

## 3. Core Architectural Boundaries & Data Flow
1. **End-User Flow**:
   - `apps/mobile` connects directly to **Supabase Edge Functions** for live radio status, reciter listings, and playlist queries.
   - Streaming audio flows directly from CDN/Icecast (`infrastructure/icecast`) or Supabase Storage buckets.
   - Remote config updates are processed asynchronously without blocking the user interface.
2. **Audio Processing Pipeline**:
   - Master files uploaded via `apps/admin` trigger `services/audio-worker`.
   - FFmpeg analyzes peaks, performs EBU R128 (-16 LUFS) normalization, extracts metadata, computes SHA-256 checksums, and renders waveforms.
   - Validated metadata is saved into Supabase PostgreSQL.
3. **Continuous Radio Broadcasting**:
   - `services/radio-engine` maintains playback schedule queues.
   - `infrastructure/liquidsoap` receives feeds, executes seamless crossfades, and streams to `infrastructure/icecast`.
   - In case of network interruption, Liquidsoap falls back to local continuous recitation loops.

## 4. Production API Path Strategy
- **Default Production Path**: Supabase Edge Functions + PostgreSQL + Storage.
- **Optional BFF**: `services/quran-yutla-api-elysia` remains an optional, non-blocking accelerator and is not required for primary operation (see `docs/ADR/0001-default-production-api-supabase-edge.md`).
